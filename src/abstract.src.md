This tutorial illustrates how to write C programs with Gtk4 library.
It focuses on beginners so the contents are limited to basic things such as widgets, GObject, signal, menus and build system.
Please refer [Gnome API reference](https://developer.gnome.org/) for further topics.

This tutorial is under development and unstable.
Even though the  examples written in C language have been tested on gtk4 version 4.0,
there might exist bugs.
If you find any bugs, errors or mistakes in the tutorial and C examples,
please let me know.
